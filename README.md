# SkillsUSA

Source code for websites created in high school SkillsUSA web design competitions in grades 9-12 (2012-2016).

It's clear I was no graphic designer. However, some of these sites got me and my partner to the national SkillsUSA competition in Louisville, KY, twice. We represented the state of Delaware for web design in [2015](2014-2015) and [2016](2015-2016).
