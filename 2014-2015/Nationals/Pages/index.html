Our economy is bad, were too involved in foreign affairs, etc. are just some of the negativity that most Americans are spreading. Yet, what about our beautiful land filled with resources, our winning record in wars against all enemies, domestic or foreign, or that we have the opportunities to participate in dreams other countries couild never reach? America is the best nation, so why don't we stop looking at negativity and develop the positivity.</span><br />

      <p align="center"><span class="about_title"><strong></strong></span><strong>10 Things that are Right  About America</strong><br />
      <em>By Troy Rampy, Editor, The  Wellness Blog™</em></p>
      <p align="center"><br />
        <a href="http://wellbeinglifestyles.com/10-things-that-are-right-about-america/">http://wellbeinglifestyles.com/10-things-that-are-right-about-america/</a></p>
      <p align="center"><br />
        <strong>In celebration of America&rsquo;s 235th birthday Troy Rampy  published the following list:</strong><br />
      <strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em><strong>Our Founding  Fathers.</strong></em> Jefferson, Washington, Franklin, Adams, Madison and several  others were seminal thinkers of The Enlightenment. They captured the spirit,  exuberance and verve of that time and transformed it into a movement and a  force that has stood the test of time. What they thought, said, did, and wrote  has inspired and challenged us, as well as billions of others, for these past  235 years. The shot heard round the world truly changed <em>everything</em>!  Huzzah for them.</p>
      <p align="center"><br />
      <img border="0" width="150" height="150" src="../Images/index_clip_image001.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" alt="http://www.wellbeinglifestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/4th-of-July-2-150x150.jpg" /><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em><strong>Our Natural Beauty</strong></em><strong>. </strong>From sea to  shining sea, this land is knock-down gorgeous. We derive much our well-deserved  sense of wonder, and yes pride, from our mountain ranges, deserts, forests,  glaciers, seashores, beaches, woodlands, canyons, volcanoes, rivers, streams,  lakes, bayous, wetlands, valleys, prairies, farmlands, ranches, orchards, and  many other wonders of nature. Thank you to The Nature Conservancy (established  1951) and the literally thousands of other organizations, and individuals, who  work tirelessly to help preserve our precious, and fragile, natural treasures.</p>
      <p align="center"><br />
      <strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em><strong>Our Spirit of  Innovation</strong></em><strong>.</strong> OMG! As a people, do we know how to  invent, innovate, and think outside the box, or what? From the light bulb,  telephone, and personal computer, to today&rsquo;s search engines and social  networks, we have led the world in many of the innovations that have literally  shaped much of the 19th and 20th centuries. Along with  that are some world-class companies and organizations that have developed  progressive business models which treat their employees and the environment  just as good as they treat their customers and their bottom-line.</p>
      <p align="center"><br />
      <strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em><strong>Our Social  Consciousness</strong></em><strong>.</strong> Okay, there&rsquo;s the Environmental, Civil  Rights, Women&rsquo;s, Gay and Lesbian movements. There are our visionary leaders  like Lincoln, King, FDR, and JFK and our transformative writers such as  Emerson, Thoreau, Maslow, Rogers, Zinn, Wilber, and others. There&rsquo;s Non-Violent  Communication, 12-Step programs, and of course, it begins with our right to  freedom of speech. I think it&rsquo;s all about our self-reflexivity, our ability to  step back and observe ourselves somewhat objectively. Then it comes down to the  fact that we&rsquo;re willing, and able, to do something about it.</p>
      <p align="center"><br />
      <strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em><strong>Our Music</strong></em><strong>. </strong>We got Ragtime! We got Dixieland! We got jazz! We got Native American!  We got Bluegrass! We got Country! We got Gospel! We got Big Band Swing! We got  Hawaiian! We got R &amp; B! We got Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; Roll! We got Hip Hop! We got  Copland, Gershwin, Porter, and Glass. We got Presley, Dylan, Simon, and  Springsteen. Oh, so many more! And we&rsquo;ve got the whole world tapping their toes  with us.</p>
      <p align="center"><br />
      <img border="0" width="150" height="150" src="../Images/index_clip_image002.jpg" align="right" hspace="12" alt="http://www.wellbeinglifestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/4th-of-July-3-150x150.jpg" /><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em><strong>Our Entertainment</strong></em><strong>. </strong>The American film  and television industries have changed the way we see, and relate to, the world  around us. Our sports, from football, baseball, and basketball, to Ultimate  Frisbee and Hula Hoops have captured our imagination, and gotten us up off the  couch. Our literature, from Whitman, Dickinson, and Twain, to Fitzgerald, Steinbeck,  and Hemingway, to Vonnegut, Irving, and Walker, has greatly enriched our lives.  Our theater, from O&rsquo;Neill, Williams, Miller, and Wilson, to Bernstein,  Sondheim, Rogers, and Hammerstein has been a delight! So has the choreography  of Balanchine, Taylor, Fosse, Graham, Robbins, and Tharp. And my personal  favorite, I&rsquo;m sorry<strong>:</strong> Disneyland.</p>
      <p align="center"><br />
      <strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em><strong>Our Cities. </strong></em>One  of the hallmarks in the evolution of civilization and contemporary culture is  the development of great cities.And it&rsquo;s no secret. We have some of  the best<strong>:</strong> San Francisco, New York, New Orleans, Chicago, and,  yes, Los Angeles. We&rsquo;ve also got Seattle, Atlanta, Boston, Austin, Washington  D.C., as well as so many more. And little charmers like Boulder, Ashland, and,  yep, Grass Valley and Nevada City!</p>
      <p align="center"><br />
      <img border="0" width="150" height="150" src="../Images/index_clip_image003.jpg" align="right" hspace="12" alt="http://www.wellbeinglifestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/4th-of-July-4-150x150.jpg" /><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em><strong>Our Sense of Style, Art, and Design. </strong></em>Okay, okay, yes  there&rsquo;s Givenchy and Gucci, but there&rsquo;s also Klein, Lauren, Blass <strong>… </strong>and,  of course, blue jeans! There&rsquo;s the Model T, WWII Jeep, Mustang, and the  DeLorian. In architecture there&rsquo;s Wright, Kahn, and Gehry. In the visual arts  there&rsquo;s Pollack, Benton, Hopper, Wyeth, and O&rsquo;Keefe. There&rsquo;s also Adams,  Leibovitz, and Avedon in photography. And several more!</p>
      <p align="center"><br />
      <strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em><strong>Our Food,  Wine &amp; Beer.</strong></em> Right, I know all about the French, Italians, and  Germans. But here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; about<strong>:</strong> New England  cuisine including indigenous &ldquo;clambake&rdquo; shellfish and many of our traditional  Thanksgiving Day foods; New York pizza; Southern cuisine and &ldquo;soul food&rdquo;; Cajun  cooking; Midwest barbecue and Chicago-style hot dogs; Tex-Mex and Southwest  cooking; upscale California cuisine; traditional Hawaiian food. And while we&rsquo;re  at it let&rsquo;s not forget Julia Child, Alice Waters, John Ash, and Bobby Flay. I&rsquo;m  also talking about American varietal wines, and especially California&rsquo;s world-class  vintages like those that bested the French at the infamous &ldquo;Paris Tasting&rdquo; of  1976. In terms of American beer, please be clear I am NOT talking about the  tasteless, mass-market swill touted in football commercials, but rather the  fine, handcrafted brews coming out of many of our micro-breweries.</p>
      <p align="center"><br />
        <strong>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em><strong>Our People, Ourselves.</strong></em> Last, but certainly not least, well worth celebrating are the fine people of  America <strong>…</strong> us! As a people, we have been described as  individualistic, fearless in believing that anything is possible, informal, and  realistic. We also exhibit an uncommon degree of concern and empathy for  others, particularly globally. We are nothing if not diverse. It has been  suggested that our pluralism might be better described as a salad bowl rather than  a melting pot. And no, it doesn&rsquo;t always go smoothly. And yes, there is much  healing that needs to occur in respect to many aspects of our diversity. But we  still manage to get a lot of it right a lot of the time. </p>
