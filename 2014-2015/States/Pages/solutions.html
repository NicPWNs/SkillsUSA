      <p>Electronic waste or e-waste are electronic products that are discarded,   broken, or unused electronic equipments like cell phones, computers, iPods, and   all other appliances.  E-waste is created when electronics are thrown away or   left unused. E-waste is increasing day-by-day as technology is ever changing.   E-waste is dumped for garbage or recycled. Recycling exposes the workers to   deadly chemicals that are used in the process of manufacturing of these   products. To prevent e-waste there are a number of things that should be kept in   mind. E-waste has become an epidemic in today&rsquo;s world. It has become a great   concern for us.</p>
      <p>E-waste is growing rapidly because of rapid growth in digitalization, product   innovation and replacement and growth of technology. E-waste problem is a global   concern and needs to be attended to immediately. Recycling and reusing of   e-waste can be hazardous as well as costly. &ldquo;Prevention is better than Cure,&rdquo; is   an old saying and fits very well to e-waste. It is first better to prevent   e-waste rather than thinking of managing e-waste.</p>
      <p>When you intend to buy an electronic device; there are a number of things   that should be kept in mind. You should always try to make as much use of the   electronics that you already have. Do not buy an electronic as soon as they are   introduced in the market, or mainly because of fashion. One should be a   need-based person rather than a want-based person. You should always control   your urge to buy new electronics.</p>
      <p>When you are buying an electronic device, you should make sure you buy   something you need and to the closest specifications that you are looking for.   You should buy an electronic device that has the capacity of changing with the   technology and upgradable. You can reduce e-waste through smart procurement and   good maintenance of electronic gadgets. When you are buying new electronic   products, always try to choose products that are made of materials with less   toxicity, greater recycled content and higher efficiency. Always buy from   companies who support the recycling and reuse of electronics and take corporate   responsibility dealing with e-waste seriously.</p>
      <p>If your electronic gadget is outdated, always consider an upgrade of the   product or the technology inbuilt, instead of replacement, or replacement of   individual component instead of the whole product. Reuse of electronics should   be encouraged if they are functioning and work well with little repair needed.   You should always purchase refurbished products as and when possible.   Refurbished products are products that are taken back by the manufacturer and   inspected to make sure they still work.  You should take good care of your   electronic devices so that they last as long as possible. Proper maintenance of   products should be done to extend their lifespan to reduce the number of e-waste   products. Whenever batteries are used, try to use rechargeable batteries   whenever necessary. Consumers should be advised and trained on simple electronic   repairs so that they can learn how to fix things for themselves, to reduce the   rate in which these materials are thrown away. All electronic devices should be   accompanied by an instruction manual for instructions dealing with good use of   the product and easy fix-it-yourself guide.</p>
      <p>Donate or sell your product to somebody who can use it if at all you do not   want to keep it. Recycle only those components of the device that cannot be   repaired. Electronics should be manufactured while keeping in mind to increase   the life span of the electronic equipment. Electronic companies should take   responsibility for the afterlife of their products. The electronics should be   sent to recycling companies. Companies should initiate take back, return   programs to encourage buyers to resell the products to the same companies they   bought it from. Electronic repair should be encouraged. Companies should   manufacture sustainable products which have long life. Hazardous materials   should not be used during the manufacturing process of electronics. Encourage   companies to slow down the introduction of new electronic products into the   market.</p>
      <p>Final and most important step is to stop buying electronics unless and until   you really need it. Governments can encourage this by charging consumers a fee   at the time of sale to reduce the increase in sales; they should also collect   fees upon disposal of an electronic product to reduce the disposal rate of   electronic products. The electronic industry can also impose high costs on   manufacturers. There should be some regulations set by the electronics industry   for introduction of new products into the industry.  Industry experts can also   explore the introduction of self healing electronics- a system of electronics   which restores conductivity to a broken circuit on their own- before even it is   noticed by the user.</p>
      <p>Prevention of e-waste will give rise to a safer and a greener earth.</p>
